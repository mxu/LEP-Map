                <p>
                    Why are some members of Congress better than others at lawmaking, from introducing bills, to advocating for them in committee hearings and floor debate, to enacting new laws? And how does variation in legislators’ effectiveness affect the organization of Congress and the creation of American public policy?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To answer these questions, we develop Legislative Effectiveness Scores (averaged to 1 in each Congress) for each member of the U.S. House of Representatives from the early 1970s through the present. In <a href="#/book">Legislative Effectiveness in the United States Congress: The Lawmakers</a>, we employ these scores to explore how parties influence legislative policymaking, what strategies women and African Americans use to promote their policy goals, and how entrepreneurial lawmakers can develop issue expertise to overcome party polarization and policy gridlock. We also highlight the twenty most effective rank-and-file Representatives of the past 40 years, identify the strategies and habits that legislators can use to become effective lawmakers, and discuss how American voters can focus on legislative effectiveness to promote a better democracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also highlight several related <a href="#/research">research projects</a> here. Finally, the Legislative Effectiveness Project will continue to update Representatives’ Legislative Effectiveness Scores in future years to provide scholars, journalists, and members of the general public with information about the relative successes of Members of the contemporary Congress.
