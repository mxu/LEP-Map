                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                <p>
                    The Legislative Effectiveness Project aims to understand why some members of Congress are generally better than others at moving their bills through the legislative process, from introducing bills into the U.S. House of Representatives, to advocating for them through committee hearings, floor debate, until they are possibly signed into law by the President of the United States.  In addition to identifying how successful some Representatives are, in comparison to others, the Legislative Effectiveness Project also seeks to understand what variation in legislators’ effectiveness in lawmaking implies for the organization of Congress and the creation of public policy in the contemporary American political system?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To engage these tasks, we develop Legislative Effectiveness Scores for each member of the U.S. House from the early 1970s through the present.  In Legislative Effectiveness in the United States Congress: The Lawmakers, we employ this metric to explore how parties influence legislative policymaking, the strategies that women and African Americans adopt in Congress to promote their policy goals, and how entrepreneurial lawmakers can develop issue expertise to overcome party polarization and policy gridlock.  We also focus on the twenty most effective rank-and-file Representatives of the past 40 years, and identify a collection of strategies and habits that legislators can use to become effective lawmakers, and discuss how American voters can focus on legislative effectiveness to promote a better democracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scores that we develop, and our analytical approach is employed in several other research projects which are highlighted on these pages. (Zach: provide link to “Research” tab here), and the Legislative Effectiveness Project with continue to update Representatives’ Legislative Effectiveness Scores in future years to provide scholars, journalists, and members of the general public with information about the relative successes of Members of the contemporary Congress.
