            <h3>What does it mean to say that you measure "Legislative Effectiveness?"</h3>
                <p>
                    In our book and related research, we define legislative effectiveness to be the “proven ability to advance a member’s agenda items through the legislative process and into law.”  In defining legislative effectiveness in this way, it is important to note that our definition consists of four separate components: proven ability, advancing legislation, members’ agenda items, and progression through the legislative process into law.  Our measure of legislative effectiveness was developed to incorporate each of these four components into a summary measure of Representatives’ “effectiveness” in lawmaking.  More specifically, the LES is constructed to measure how successful a given Representative is at moving his or her own legislative agenda items (meaning, the bills that he/she sponsors) through different stages of the legislative process, where each of those bills are also coded for relative substantive significance.  The specific formula for the LES is defined more explicitly in our methodology section, above.

                <h3>Are Legislative Effectiveness Scores comparable across time?</h3>
                <p>
                    Legislative Effectiveness Scores are normalized to be an average score of “1” within each congress.  Such a normalization facilitates easy Representative-to-Representative within a given Congress.  So, if one Representative in the 110th Congress (2007-2008) had a LES of “1” and a second Representative in the 110th Congress had a score of “2” it would be appropriate to say that the second Representative was twice as effective in lawmaking (according to our metric) as the first Representative.  Because the scores are normalized to have an average value of “1” in each Congress, however, care must be made when trying to make cross-time comparisons between Representatives and their scores (and other Representatives and their scores) across different Congresses.  While it is appropriate to compare the relative ordinal rankings of Representatives across Congresses (for example, to say that Representative A was in the 99th percentile in effectiveness in Congress 1, but only in the 80th percentile in effectiveness in Congress 2), making direct comparisons between their scores would not necessarily be appropriate.  In our book we document, extensively, how the cross-congress correlations between scores are consistently positive (meaning that Representatives who have high LESs in earlier congresses are likely to have high LESs in subsequent congresses), and the correlation between the ordinal rankings of Representatives across Congresses are also consistently positive (meaning, for example, that Representatives who are among the most effective members in the Congress in a given term are likely to be among the most effective members in Congress in subsequent terms), but care should still be made before drawing inferences based on comparisons of the raw LESs between congresses.

            <div class="def-panel" id="lowLes">
                <h3>If a Representative has a low LES, does that mean that she is not an effective lawmaker?</h3>
                <p>
                    Not necessarily.  As described above, the LES is designed to measure how successful a given Representative is at moving his or her own legislative agenda items (meaning, the bills that he/she sponsors) through different stages of the legislative process, where those bills are also coded for substantive significance.  If a Representative has a relatively low LES, it could be the result of him/her not introducing many bills and/or those bills not moving particularly far in the legislative process, relative to other members of the U.S. House.  That said, it is quite plausible that the Representative contributes extensively to the lawmaking process, but his or her efforts are simply being directed towards advancing the legislative agenda items that have been sponsored by other Representatives.

                <h3>What is the range of the Legislative Effectiveness Scores?</h3>
                <p>
                    As noted above, the Legislative Effectiveness Scores are normalized to be an average of “1” within each congress. That said, the scores exhibit significant variance within and across congresses, ranging from a low of “0” for those Representatives who didn’t introduce any bills in a given congress, to a high of 18.68639, which was Representative Charles Rangel’s (D-NY) Legislative Effectiveness Score in the 110th Congress (2007-2008).

                <h3>Does a Legislative Effectiveness Score capture if a Representative is effective at stopping legislation from moving forward?</h3>
                <p>
                    No.  As described above, the Legislative Effectiveness Score is constructed to measure how successful a given Representative is at moving his or her own legislative agenda items (meaning, the bills that he/she sponsors) through different stages of the legislative process, where each of those bills are also coded for relative substantive significance.  Hence, it only captures how successful (i.e., effective) a Representative is at moving bills that she has sponsored forward in the legislative process.  Any success that a Representative might have in slowing down, or stopping, the progression of bills through the legislative process is therefor note captured by the measure.

                <h3>Does a Legislative Effectiveness Score account for Representatives' amendment activites?</h3>
                <p> 
                    The Legislative Effectiveness Scores that are available on this website, and were the focus of much of the analysis in the book and related published research do not account for the impact of Representatives’ amendment activities on their respective effectiveness.  In Appendix 2.1 of Chapter 2 of Legislative Effectiveness in the United States Congress: The Lawmakers, however, we present analysis where Representatives’ Legislative Effectiveness Scores are influenced by their success and/or failure in amending legislation, as well as whether their legislation attracts, or defends itself, from amendment activity.  As demonstrated in Appendix 2.1, the main substantive points of analysis that are presented in our work does not change if one accounts for Representatives’ amendment activities in the ways that we explore there.

                <h3>Do you have Legislative Effectiveness Scores for the Senate?</h3>
                <p>
                    Our current analysis only focuses on the U.S. House of Representatives.  While it would be very interesting to study the legislative effectiveness of members of the U.S. Senate, the method that we use to calculate LESs for the U.S. House would have to be altered in certain ways for our metric to be substantively meaningful in regards to the U.S. Senate.  For example, the formula that we employ currently gives Representatives greater credit for successfully advancing their bills beyond committee onto the floor of the U.S. House.  In the U.S. Senate, however, bills don’t necessarily have to be reported out of committee for them to reach the floor for consideration; so giving Senators credit for having their bills be reported out of committee might not be as substantively meaningful (in regards to likely prospects of legislative success) as it is in the U.S. House.
