            <h3>What does it mean to say that you measure "Legislative Effectiveness?"</h3>
                <p>
                    In our book and related research, we define legislative effectiveness to be the “proven ability to advance a member’s agenda items through the legislative process and into law.”  In defining legislative effectiveness in this way, it is important to note that our definition consists of four separate components: proven ability, advancing legislation, members’ agenda items, and progression through the legislative process into law.  Our measure of legislative effectiveness was developed to incorporate each of these four components into a summary measure of Representatives’ “effectiveness” in lawmaking.  More specifically, the LES is constructed to measure how successful a given Representative is at moving his or her own legislative agenda items (meaning, the bills that he/she sponsors) through different stages of the legislative process, where each of those bills are also coded for relative substantive significance.  The specific formula for the LES is defined more explicitly in our methodology section.

                <h3>Are Legislative Effectiveness Scores comparable across time?</h3>
                <p>Legislative Effectiveness Scores are normalized to be an average score of “1” within each Congress. Such a normalization facilitates easy Representative-to-Representative comparisons within a given Congress. So, if one Representative in the 110th Congress (2007-2008) had a LES of “1” and a second Representative in the 110th Congress had a score of “2” it would be appropriate to say that the second Representative was twice as effective in lawmaking (according to our metric) as the first Representative. Because the scores are normalized to have an average value of “1” in each Congress, however, care must be made when trying to compare Representatives and their scores (and other Representatives and their scores) across different Congresses. While it is appropriate to compare the relative ordinal rankings of Representatives across Congresses (for example, to say that Representative A was the most effective Republican in the 110th Congress, but only the 20th most effective in the 111th Congress), and the correlation between the ordinal rankings of Representatives across Congresses are also consistently positive; but care should still be made before drawing inferences based on comparisons of the raw LESs between Congresses.</p>

            <div class="def-panel" id="lowLes">
                <h3>If a Representative has a low LES, does that mean that she is not an effective lawmaker?</h3>
                <p>Not necessarily. As described above, the LES is designed to measure how successful a given Representative is at moving his or her own legislative agenda items (meaning, the bills that he/she sponsors) through different stages of the legislative process, where those bills are also coded for substantive significance. A relatively low LES results from few introductions or from sponsored bills not progressing particularly far. That said, other efforts that may be commonly considered “legislative effectiveness,” such as working behind the scenes to help others' bills pass, serving as Speaker of the House, or blocking proposals of other opponents, are not included in calculating the LES.</p>

                <h3>What is the range of the Legislative Effectiveness Scores?</h3>
                <p>Legislative Effectiveness Scores are normalized to be an average of “1” within each Congress. That said, the scores exhibit significant variance within and across Congresses, ranging from a low of “0” for those Representatives who didn't introduce any bills in a given Congress, to a high of 18.686, for Representative Charles Rangel (D-NY) in the 110th Congress (2007-2008).</p>

                <h3>Does a Legislative Effectiveness Score capture if a Representative is effective at stopping legislation from moving forward?</h3>
                <p>No. As described above, the Legislative Effectiveness Score is constructed to measure how successful a given Representative is at moving his or her own legislative agenda items (meaning, the bills that he/she sponsors) through different stages of the legislative process, where each of those bills are also coded for relative substantive significance. Hence, it only captures how successful (i.e., effective) a Representative is at moving bills that she has sponsored forward in the legislative process. Any success that a Representative might have in slowing down, or stopping, the progression of others' bills through the legislative process is therefore not captured by the measure.</p>

                <h3>Does a Legislative Effectiveness Score account for Representatives' amendment activities?</h3>
                <p>The Legislative Effectiveness Scores that are available on this website, and were the focus of much of the analysis in <a href="#/book">the book</a> and related <a href="#/research">published research</a> do not account for the impact of Representatives' amendment activities on their respective effectiveness. In Appendix 2.1 of Chapter 2 of <em>Legislative Effectiveness in the United States Congress: The Lawmakers</em>, however, we present analysis where Representatives' Legislative Effectiveness Scores are influenced by their success and/or failure in amending legislation, as well as whether their legislation attracts; or defends itself; from amendment activity. As demonstrated in Appendix 2.1, the main substantive points of analysis that are presented in our work do not change if one accounts for Representatives' amendment activities in the ways that we explore there.</p>

                <h3>Do you have Legislative Effectiveness Scores for the Senate?</h3>
                <p>
                    Our current analysis only focuses on the U.S. House of Representatives.  While it would be very interesting to study the legislative effectiveness of members of the U.S. Senate, the method that we use to calculate LESs for the U.S. House would have to be altered in certain ways for our metric to be substantively meaningful in regards to the U.S. Senate.  For example, the formula that we employ currently gives Representatives greater credit for successfully advancing their bills beyond committee onto the floor of the U.S. House.  In the U.S. Senate, however, bills don’t necessarily have to be reported out of committee for them to reach the floor for consideration; so giving Senators credit for having their bills be reported out of committee might not be as substantively meaningful (in regards to likely prospects of legislative success) as it is in the U.S. House.

                <h3>Why can't I find out the Legislative Effectiveness Score of a Representative in the current Congress?</h3>
                <p>
                    As described on the Methodology page, a Representative's Legislative Effectiveness Score is a parsimonious metric of how successful she was at moving her agenda items through each of five stages in the legislative process, where each agenda item is coded for substantive significance, in comparison to all other members of the House of Representatives. In order to calculate this metric, it is necessary to know how successful each member of the House was at advancing her agenda items through Congress, which can only be ascertained at the conclusion of a given Congress. Likewise, one aspect of the coding protocol--identifying whether a bill that was introduced in a Congress is "substantive and significant"--can only be ascertained by consulting the CQ Almanac that corresponds to that particular Congress, which is only published after the conclusion of each session of Congress. Hence, it is substantively inappropriate (and technically impossible) to replicate our methodology to calculate Legislative Effectiveness Scores for Representatives that are sitting in a current 2-year Congress before that Congress has concluded.

                <h3>Why is the Legislative Effectiveness Score calculated based solely on H.R.s?</h3>
                <p>
                    In undertaking the Legislative Effectiveness Project, we are most interested in understanding why some legislators are more effective than others at advancing bills through the legislative process that have substantive consequences for changes in policy. While many other legislative vehicles have the potential for facilitating substantial changes to public policy in the United States (in particular, H.J. RESs, that engage proposed constitutional amendments), and engage potentially contentious issues in the American polity, most resolutions and related measures are largely symbolic in substance, and have no de jure force of law. Hence, we disregard all legislative vehicles that cannot lead to a direct change in U.S. Code if signed by the President.

                <h3>Is the sponsored legislation itself "effective"?</h3>
                <p>
                    We are not able to answer this question, or related questions about the efficacy of the legislation that is being sponsored by members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Our methodology allows us to measure how effective Representatives are at moving their agenda items forward in the legislative process, but it can’t speak to any questions about the relative effectiveness of the bills that are proposed and/or the laws that are ultimately promulgated.
