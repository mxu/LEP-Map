                <p>While congressional scholars have paid substantial attention to questions of representation, we have devoted relatively little energy to understanding which members of Congress are most effective at lawmaking, and why.  In this essay, we advocate an aggressive agenda to incorporate legislative effectiveness more fully into theoretical and empirical examinations of Congress.  To facilitate this effort, we develop a method for ranking members of the U.S. House of Representatives in terms of their effectiveness at moving bills through the legislative process, and we apply this method to generate a Legislative Effectiveness Score (LES) for every House member in each of the 93rd-110th Congresses (1973-2008).  We examine how a member’s legislative effectiveness arises from different personal and institutional factors, such as the member’s party, her seniority, and whether she holds a committee chair.  We identify a complex relationship between a member’s legislative effectiveness and her representational effectiveness, and conclude that future scholarship on Congress must be more centrally focused on legislative effectiveness.</p>

                <p class="text-muted"><em>American Journal of Political Science</em></p>

                <p>Previous scholarship has demonstrated that female lawmakers differ from their male counterparts by engaging more fully in consensus-building activities. We argue that this behavioral difference does not serve women equally well in all institutional settings. Contentious and partisan activities of male lawmakers may help them outperform women when in a polarized majority party. However, in the minority party, while men may choose to obstruct and delay, women continue to strive to build coalitions and bring about new policies. We find strong evidence that minority party women in the U.S. House of Representatives are better able to keep their sponsored bills alive through later stages of the legislative process than are minority party men, across the 93rd–110th Congresses (1973–2008). The opposite is true for majority party women, however, who counterbalance this lack of later success by introducing more legislation. Moreover, while the legislative style of minority party women has served them well consistently across the past four decades, majority party women have become less effective as Congress has become more polarized.</p>

                <h4>"Breaking Gridlock: The Determinants of Health Policy Change in Congress"<br><small>Craig Volden and Alan E. Wiseman</small></h4>

                <p class="text-muted"><em>Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law</em></p>
                
                <p>Prior to the 2010 health care reforms, scholars often commented that health policy making in Congress was mired in political gridlock, that reforms were far more likely to fail than to succeed, and that the path forward was unclear. In light of recent events, new narratives are being advanced. In formulating these assessments, scholars of health politics tend to analyze individual major reform proposals to determine why they succeeded or failed and what lessons could be drawn for the future. Taking a different approach, we examine all health policies proposed in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1973 and 2002. We analyze these bills' fates and the effectiveness of their sponsors in guiding these proposals through Congress. Setting these proposed policies against a baseline of policy advancements in other areas, we demonstrate that health policy making has indeed been far more gridlocked than policy making in most other areas. We then isolate some of the causes of this gridlock, as well as some of the conditions that have helped to bring about health policy change.</p>

                <p>We develop a formal model of lawmaking wherein a legislator makes a policy proposal consisting of a bill in a unidimensional policy space and a level of valence.  A legislator can add valence to a policy by exerting effort, with her effectiveness in policymaking captured by her relative costs of doing so.  Equilibrium results identify the circumstances under which a legislator can successfully propose non-median policies, and the conditions under which substantial valence investments are made.  We also identify when the legislator will choose to retain the status quo policy, despite being able to successfully propose an ideologically closer alternative.  Numerous existing spatial models emerge as special cases of our model and its extensions.  We conclude with initial empirical tests of some of the model’s surprising predictions.</p>
